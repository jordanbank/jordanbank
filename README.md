**Self-taught** at heart, web development is for me a way to express an idea, a concept and to help a maximum of people. Passionate about new technologies since my teenage years, I never stop learning from experts in the field.

I like to work in a **healthy environment**, with an organized and efficient work **methodology**, that's why I question my practices every day and constantly improve myself in this area. In my opinion, a developer should not just implement features but should be a **thinker**, think outside the box and be a **perfectionist**.

Whatever the project, I do everything possible to make it exemplary, first with a development respectful of **OWASP standards** as restrictive as possible, then with a design oriented **accessibility**, **performance** and **SEO** so that it is usable by anyone.

**Sharing** allows me to learn, to confront myself with other points of view and to experiment with my mistakes. That's why I set up a blog on which I share articles about web development.
